****Problem:****

Non-automated restaurant that make use of pen and paper for when a waiter is placing
orders for customers. The placing of orders takes a great amount of time for waiters 
because of travelling back and forth to the kitchen staff to submit an order. My program 
will effectively record a waiter order so that orders are in a first come, first serve approach 
when delivered to kitchen staff.

    any difficulty.

2. The system should be able to take any amount of orders and display

    user for the mode of payment and generate a receipt.  
    
4. The System must pass order to kitchen staff and show the effective status
   order status that are available or still busy.    

5. The System should allow managers to generate a report.
